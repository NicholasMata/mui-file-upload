# FileDropzone
:::note
This component is the most important in the whole library.
:::

This is what captures files being dragged over it. Both [MultiFileUpload](../basics/MultiFileUpload) and
[SingleFileUpload](../basics/SingleFileUpload) are built off this component.

*The hope is that others will take this component and make their own components.*
