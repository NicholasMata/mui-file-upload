# useXMLHttpService

This hook is used to provide a uploadService to your FileUpload components.

:::info
The name of this hook is a bit of a misnamor as it has nothing to do with XML specifically. Rather the name indicates that it uses
the [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest). 
The reason it uses [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) over 
something like `fetch` is because it allows for tracking upload progress.

Returns: [FileUploadService\<Response\>](../types/FileUploadService)
