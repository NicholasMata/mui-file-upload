# FileUploadService

```tsx
type FileUploadService<Response = string> = (
  file: File,
  onProgress: (progress: number) => void
) => Promise<Response>

```

An async function that can be called with a File and a function to track the progress of the upload.

Review [useXMLHttpService](../hooks/useXMLHttpService) for an existing implementation.

This type is meant as an abstraction so you can use any http / socket connection library.
An example being [useXMLHttpService](../hooks/useXMLHttpService) could be recreated functionality wise with 
something like [axios](https://axios-http.com).
