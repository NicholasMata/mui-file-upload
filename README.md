# Material UI File Upload

> <b>NOT AN OFFICAL MUI LIBRARY</b>

Provides components and hooks to upload files which has a Material UI style.

This package is built on [MUI](https://mui.com) and <b>is just meant to be temporary until MUI makes equalivant components</b> Which is on their [roadmap](https://mui.com/material-ui/discover-more/roadmap/) as Dropzone and File Upload.

## Installation

You can install the package using npm or yarn
